# Grass Audio

A simple wrapper around the BASS library, that allows you to play audio files without gaps. Used on
the [Grass Music Player](https://github.com/lpradopostigo/grass-music-player).
**NOTE: this library is no longer developed, is functional but is not thread safe. Grass Music Player now uses its own wrapper written in Rust**

## Get started

**NOTE: For now ,available targets are win_x64**
